Responsive Design Fundamentals

Responsive design is an approach to web design in which a site is 
constructed to provide a best viewing experience easy reading and 
navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling across a 
wide range of devices such as desktop computer monitors to mobile phones. 
There are three fundamentals techniques for responsive design such as, 
Fluid Grids, Media Queries, and Flexible media. There is a need for sites 
to be viewed to mobile. There is a rise of mobile computers that are 
making up the market share. 
Responsive Design is made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Html consists of 
clean code, proper semantics and HTML5. CSS consists of media queries 
which contains resolution, fluid layout usually flex in order to fit the 
screen, transitions and CSS graphics. Also JavaScript consists of resource 
loading, adaptive media, and device functionality.
	Next it is important in responsive Design to control viewports. 
There are two ways such as viewport meta tag and @viewport CSS rule. The 
Meta viewport tag appears in the head of your HTML, and has two basic 
parts: name, which contains viewport and content, which will contain 
properties and values in which you set. Also @viewport rule can appear 
anywhere in your CSS that you want but you have to set before any media 
queries.
	After there is many ways for how we can improve graphics for 
higher- density display. One way is to reduce bitmap graphics by using 
vector image formats like SVG, or use CSS in place of simple graphics. SVG 
has its drawbacks because SVG images can be considerably larger than their 
bitmap counterparts, and vector graphics are redrawn with each pan and 
zoom. Also CSS has its problems such as its limitations, that consists of 
complex artwork is often out of the range of its capabilities, and often 
non-semantic markup is required to achieve the desired results. Also you 
can use icon fonts for icons. These are easy to resize.
	In addition Media Queries are important part of responsive design, 
as they allows you to write styles that respond to changes in things like 
screen size or orientation. There are many media features that needed to 
be tested in order to place the right size screen. The list goes as width, 
height, device-width, device-height, orientation, aspect-ratio, device 
aspect ratio, color, color index, monochrome, resolution, scan and grid. 
	Another thing that is important is creating breakpoints wit media 
queries. Breakpoint is the moment a layout changes from one layout to 
another , usually triggered by the width of the viewport. There is an 
example for mobile style has the max-width: 480px, or min-width: 481px and 
max- width: 768px for tablets. Also they have break points for desktop 
min-width: 769px. There is another way of doing instead of using pixel, 
for example you could use ems. You take the number of pixels and divide it 
by 16 to get your ems. Using ems, the width of the screen is set relative 
to the devices font size.
	Another important topic that is important is fluid grids. Fluid 
grids are use to make crafting multiple layouts faster and more precise. 
Grid systems are a fantastic way of creating structured and properly 
proportioned layouts. In web design, grids are typically defined as a 
number of columns and gutters that are used by the designer to establish 
the widths of the page elements and regions. 16-px-based grid is often 
used as the default size for most browsers. Fluid grids have a down side, 
for example the styles are heavily class-based and usually use 
non-semantic class names that can clutter up your HTML. Also most of these 
frameworks are fairly large in size.
	Performance is another important key of building a successful 
responsive web design. A simple way of doing it is keeping the code clean, 
by having it lean and less clutter. It is important to have four different 
sheets for desktop, tablet, smartphone and print styles into single style 
sheet. Your objective is to reduce request to improve performance. 
	On planning a responsive design is that you have to know your 
content. It is better to start with a mobile space than desktop, because 
you are force to design within a narrow linear space. Also you have to 
think about device functionality, such as geo location, instant messaging, 
and touch sensitivity. Plus you have to consider layout considerations. 
This includes planning out your navigation, and creating consistent coding 
standards. 
            Building responsive mockups was mention in the learning video. 
Designing in a browser is difficult which consist of designing flexible 
layouts, starting with extremes and defining breakpoints and tweakpoints. 
Keynote and PowerPoint is increasingly being used to create responsive 
prototypes. Another method that designers used is HTML and CSS because 
they could simulate how content flows responsively and initial frameworks.
	Content strategy is important to responsive design. This strategy 
is useful because it require the practice of identifying, organizing, and 
managing a sites content. The objective is to emphasize on important 
content, make relationships clear and make content accessible on a small 
screens.
	Testing responsive design consist of resizing windows. Another way 
of testing was using online tools, or responsator, screen queries, 
mobittest, mobile emulator like Test iphone, opera Mini and Apple SDK. 
MobiForge is also an good one. Also testing on the devices itself.
	Fluid grid framework is good for speeding up development, helps 
keep consistent code and solid starting code base. Simplegrid.info, golden 
grid , columnal and responsivegridsystem.com. 
	Design tools are needed to create a responsive design. 
Jeremypalford.com can used to sketch out ideas. Tinyfluidgrid.com, which 
allows to set quick parameters. Categorizer, which could be use to perform 
platform-specific actions. Modernizer.com features asynchronous resource 
loading, an ability to test against the results of media queries. 
Fitvidsjs.com helps create fluid video embeds on your page.
